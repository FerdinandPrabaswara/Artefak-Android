Artefak-Android is part of my undergraduate research project for obtaining a Bachelor’s degree.
This study analyzes the effect of Floating Action Button (FAB) placement in mobile applications, Android.

The experiment evaluates three different FAB positions by measuring user productivity through
Task Completion Time (TCT) and mistakes.

The results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference among the three FAB positions
in terms of TCT and mistakes.

This repository contains the Android prototype and experimental artifacts used in the study.
